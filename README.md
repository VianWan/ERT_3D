# Direct current resistivity

***Hi ~***

This following work  is set some python script into there, unhhh may need long time to refine, most generic process such as, removing outlier data, plotting pseudo-section normalization resistivity  image and electrode array.  

The Forward and inversion package for 3D also can be find in there, if i  finish them one day.



Actually, this is my second current graduate student year, so i just a cub researcher. Ambient noise tomography is my new interesting research, which also be pulled in there. 

To be continuedðŸ¤­.
